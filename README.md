# Life Timer

Life Timer is an interactive web application designed to visually represent the passage of time. Users input their birthdate, and the app begins a countdown, displaying their age in real-time. This visual timer serves as a reminder of life's finite nature and encourages users to reflect on how they spend their time.

The project was inspired by [this website](https://currentage.netlify.app), which offers a similar concept of tracking and visualizing time elapsed since a person's birth.
